The developer of the tool worked with me to adjust the input and output of the tool. Passing `--format json` causes standard output to be in JSON which is more easily consumed by software. \n\n```\n$ mykrobe_atlas predict\\\n    --sample MDR_1\\\n    --species tb\\\n    --seq /MDR_1.fastq.gz\\ \n    --format json\n```\n\nThe final prototype took the form of a fully signed app containing the command-line tool, proving that the front-end was able to communicate with the tool to analyse a sequence and then display the results to the end user. We were also able to build and run the same app on Linux and Windows, making it more attractive in terms of effort to build and maintain over the long term.\n\n##### Building the first product\nThe visual designs were next implemented in the prototype, with added animations added to the splash screen and simple transitions between screens adding to the charm. We added drag-and-drop support which means that with the final production app users can simply drag a DNA sequence file into the app and then view the results within a couple of minutes. \n\nThe product owner gave a memorable real-time demo of this in Mumbai which received many gasps with the audience wondering how this was possible.\n"

Following a cycle of team reviews and prototype refinements we eventually landed on a satisfying visualisation generated in the browser.\n\n##### Tree data structure\nI was then able to work with one of the back-end developers to arrive on a JSON data structure which could be generated dynamically via Neo4J.

This allows the Electron and web-based apps to share the same code base, diverging when needed for specific functionality.\n\n##### Bridging the gap\nI worked closely with the back-end developers against an [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/) spec, with some realtime events using [Server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).\n"

Many TB labs were forced to change their focus to analysing COVID-19 during the pandemic. This made it impossible to undertake the final pilot and user testing that we had planned.\n\nOne other problem was unique to this particular project - the technology is so advanced that none of our users were able to easily grasp what it could do or specifically what they might use it for. This meant we had to push the fidelity of our testable prototypes further than expected so that users would be able to engage with them in a useful way unlocking the necessary insight.\n\n##### Reflection\nWhat started out as a small identity and UI project eventually scaled into a multi-year multi-platform product. The other team members were humble, bright and inspiring and I learned so much about pathogens and diagnostics, as well as having my eyes opened to the realities of every day existence in other parts of the world. I was named author on my first published research paper as an acknowledgment of my overall contribution.\n\nIt is still hard to believe that you can put a swab sample in a fancy USB stick then see a complete DNA analysis on your laptop screen within a couple of minutes. It was an honour and privilege to work with people who make such breakthroughs possible.\n"
