There were a few ways of achieving this; the best one turned out to be using the [elastic collision](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/work/elastic-collision/) code, but adding attractive forces. There is a fair amount of mathematical calculation going on per frame. Flash 9 Alpha came out at around the same time, so out of curiosity I rewrote the initial ‘sketch’ concept in AS3\\.

I now have a Screensavr that works perfectly, honouring all image proportions. Looks great, but runs slowly in Flash as it can’t handle so many individual images as the bitmap processing isn’t sophisticated enough; had to make it so that each row is a series of MovieClips rather than one BitmapData object. Setting cacheAsBitmap was causing too much flickering; turning it off makes it run too slow.\n\nUnless there’s a major brainwave, a Cocoa rewrite is on the cards. This could take some time…\n\n[Download for Mac](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/screensavrinstallr-003.zip \"screensavrinstallr-003.zip\")"

          "content": "One of the problems I had when writing [Flash Screensavr](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/2007/02/04/screensavr-dead-end-new-beginning/) was sharing preferences between two separate and different SWF files – the Preferences panel and the Screensaver itself. Obviously a job for SharedObject.\n\nHowever there is a trick to creating a SharedObject that behaves how you’d expect.\n\nIf you’re like me, you would think the correct code is;\n\n\\[as\\] var my\\_so:SharedObject; my\\_so = SharedObject.getLocal(“com.simonheys.screensavr”); \\[/as\\]\n\nBut this results in a SharedObject which can only be accessed by the SWF that created it…not what I wanted. The not-very-obvious solution is to add a second parameter which is referred to simply as ‘localPath’ in the docs;\n\n\\[as\\] var my\\_so:SharedObject; my\\_so = SharedObject.getLocal(“com.simonheys.screensavr”,”/”); \\[/as\\]\n\nThat’s it! You now have a useful SharedObject which you can access from any SWF on your machine. Having spent literally hours trying to track down the solution I decided to write a nice preferences class in a similar style to the one I use in Cocoa. Applications usually have unique preferences, so this is customised for each one.\n\n\\[as\\] class com.simonheys.projects.screensavr.ScreensavrPreferences { public static var PHOTOSTREAM:Number = 0, PHOTOSET:Number = 1, GROUP:Number = 2, FAVOURITES:Number = 3; public var useHighQuality:Boolean, username:String, sourceType:Number, sourceId:String, speed:Number; private var \\_soId:String; public function setSharedObjectId(soId:String):Void { \\_soId = soId; } public function storeInSharedObject():Void { var my\\_so:SharedObject = SharedObject.getLocal(\\_soId,”/”); my\\_so.data.username = username; my\\_so.data.sourceType = sourceType; my\\_so.data.sourceId = sourceId; my\\_so.data.speed = speed; my\\_so.data.useHighQuality = useHighQuality; my\\_so.flush(); } public function retreiveFromSharedObject():Void { var my\\_so:SharedObject = SharedObject.getLocal(\\_soId,”/”); username = my\\_so.data.username; sourceType = my\\_so.data.sourceType; sourceId = my\\_so.data.sourceId; speed = my\\_so.data.speed; useHighQuality = my\\_so.data.useHighQuality; } } \\[/as\\]\n\nI did think about having methods called ‘save’ and ‘load’ but was obviously feeling verbose that day. You could of course have this as a Singleton in Flash, but I didn’t need to.\n\nThe code for using the prefs is then as simple as this:\n\n\\[as\\] \\_preferences = new ScreensavrPreferences(); \\_preferences.setSharedObjectId(Constants.SHARED\\_OBJECT\\_ID); \\_preferences.retreiveFromSharedObject(); // retrieve a value highQualityCheckBox.selected = \\_preferences.useHighQuality; // store a value \\_preferences.sourceType = ScreensavrPreferences.PHOTOSTREAM; \\_preferences.storeInSharedObject(); \\[/as\\]\n\nWhere `Constants.SHARED_OBJECT_ID` is something like `com.simonheys.preferences.screensavr`."

The first one is the [Vector Field demo](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/work/vector-field-example/) I wrote ages ago.\n\n#### First, the source code\n\n[\\[ZIP\\] Download Vector Field source code](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/files/vectorfield.zip)\n\nIt’s easy to change the size, colour and ‘splat’ graphics. This is totally free for non-commercial use, but I kindly ask that you contact me if you wish to use it for something commercial.\n\nPart of the reason I’m posting this is because it has a bug which I can’t figure out how to fix. To explain what the bug is I need to explain how this works. So here goes.\n\n#### Vector Fields and fluids\n\nAt some point last year I wanted to create a fluid / liquid simulation and had been looking at [Vector Fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector%5Ffield) and their use in fluid simulations. These work by having a huge matrix of vectors, the direction of which are controlled by the fluid algorithm. Here’s a very simple example:\n\n![field.gif](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/field.gif)\n\nEach vector in the field has two components, one for the horizontal movement x, and another for the vertical movement y. A 3d field would have a third component, z.\n\nParticles or colour or whatever is required to turn this into a visualisation are moved around according to the vector field. If there is a particle on top of the vector shown above then it will move 0.5 units along x and 0.45 along y. If a force is applied to disturb the liquid then some of the vectors would correspondingly increase in magnitude. Scale this up to a larger system and you have the basics of a fluid simulation. \n\nThis is an enormous amount of computation, and even for a tiny area of 100×100 pixels you’d need 10,000 vectors. This seemed totally beyond the scope of Flash 8 which is still sluggish in math performance compared to Flash 9 or Java.\n\n#### Vector Fields and DisplacementMap\n\nThen I started playing around with DisplacementMaps. I’d seen various demo’s of the [3d spinning globe](http://nodename.com/blog/2006/01/16/psyarks-displacementmapfilter-tutorial/) variety and was intrigued as to how it was done, particularly as the displacement map never looked, on the surface at least, to have much bearing on what actually happens.\n\nThankfully it’s all much simpler than the Flash documentation led me to believe. Displacement maps have two channels – one controlling horizontal movement and the other controlling vertical movement. This was starting to sound familiar:\n\n![field2.gif](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/field2.gif)\n\nHallelujah! A DisplacementMap is effectively a huge array of vectors, and perfect for a fluid simulation. There’s a small amount of math that converts between the component value of each colour channel and the corresponding x or y movement;\n\n\\[as\\] dstPixel\\[x, y\\] = srcPixel\\[ x + ((componentX(x, y) – 128) \\* scaleX) / 256, y + ((componentY(x, y) – 128) \\* scaleY) / 256 \\]; \\[/as\\]\n\nI spent ages staring at this line of code, but it’s really easy. Taking the horizontal channel as an example: a value of 128 doesn’t move at all; less than 128 would move left and more than 128 would move right. You specify a scale value when creating the DisplacementMap that controls the magnitude of movement in either direction.\n\nI quickly wrote this demo and was very pleased with the result, especially the nice surprise of the colours mixing together. It’s really simple; there is a displacement map, and a brush like the soft brush in PhotoShop. When you drag with the mouse the code calculates the corresponding colour for that movement and paints onto the displacement map. This causes fluid-like movement:\n\n#### And now, the bug\n\nWhen you play with the code you will notice that occasionally you get ‘dead pixels’ in the liquid. I find this intensely annoying. I have tried several fixes but have yet to solve it. Here’s what you see:\n\n![swirl-grr.jpg](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/swirl-grr.jpg)\n\nGrrr. At first I thought it would just be a case of using a threshold call to change all elements with a value of 128,128 (ie. not moving) into something else. But it doesn’t work because the real problem is when you have two pixels next to each other which are pointing in opposing directions, canceling each other out. So I also tried a Gaussian blur, but this has a weird effect where the whole movement shifts off balance and tends towards the bottom-right.\n\nI am out of ideas on this one and am hoping someone else can think of nice a workaround.\n\nAll ideas welcome."

The appeal has always been to make photos without using lenses or carefully controlled photographic processes. I’ve never been a big fan of photography; the equipment and techniques are now so honed and precise leading the majority of photographs to appear somewhat mechanical and soul-less. I want the surprise of the accidental rather than the boredom of the deliberate. \n\nI originally bought the base chemicals from the excellent [Silverprint](http://www.silverprint.co.uk/) in Waterloo but used them up long ago. Inspired by the recent sunny weather I thought I’d try one of their [alternative process kits](http://www.silverprint.co.uk/altproc9.html) which includes various bits and pieces like a measuring cup, syringe and coating rods which make the job that much easier. Rather than the usual contact prints with plants or [other stuff](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/archive/22/), I thought it might be interesting to try a pinhole camera. \n\nOf course since the kit arrived the sun has gone into hiding and consequently I’ve not been able to make much progress. This was an exposure I took yesterday. I couldn’t class it as a photograph at all, but I like the way it turned out all the same."

I think it’s a hidden gem. Not only is it a fascinating [programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript#The%5Flanguage) which can be used to create generative drawings and save you hours of time through automation, but you can also use it as an intermediary format to transfer output from other languages such as Flash ActionScript or Java / Processing into Adobe Illustrator.\n\n#### A simple PostScript program\n\nCopy and paste this into a text editor (NotePad or TextEdit), save it as ‘simple.ps’ and then open it in Illustrator.\n\n\r\n%!PS-Adobe-3.0 \r\n\r\n0 0 moveto\r\n100 100 lineto\r\nstroke\r\n\r\nshowpage\r\nThis little snippet gives the following result:\n\n![ps-line.gif](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/ps-line.gif) \n\nA line from 0,0 to 100,100\\. Amazing, eh? Not really, but the point is that the code is really simple to understand and we’re only using the line drawing command. If you go slow and learn one command at a time, you can eventually do some pretty interesting and useful things.\n\n#### Learning PostScript\n\nThere are  lots of PostScript tutorials on the web that will explain the basic concepts. One thing to note is that PostScript is [stack based](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based) which means you push numbers onto the stack before operating on them. In raw code it makes it look like you’re doing things backwards and can seem off-putting. In practise it’s very simple and logical.\n\nThe essential guide to PostScript is the PLRM or ‘red book’. I bought a copy of this years ago and it’s pretty big at 800 pages! But thanks to the generosity of Adobe you can now download it online;\n\n[\\[PDF\\] PostScript Language Reference Manual, third edition](http://www.adobe.com/products/postscript/pdfs/PLRM.pdf)\n\n#### A lot, for a little\n\nOnce you’ve learned a few commands you’ll be able to achieve a lot with very little. Here’s something more advanced using a for-loop in conjunction with graphics transformation;\n\n\r\n%!PS-Adobe-3.0 \r\n\r\n0.75 setlinewidth\r\n0.75 setgray\r\n\r\n0 3 360 {\r\n\tnewpath\r\n\tgsave\r\n\t0 0 moveto\r\n\trotate\r\n\t100 0 rlineto\r\n\tstroke\r\n\tgrestore\r\n} for\r\n\r\nshowpage\r\nProduces the following result: ![picture-4.gif](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/picture-4.gif) \n\nWhich is starting to look a bit more interesting, and like something that might be tricky to create purely ‘by hand’ in Illustrator. I’ve used techniques based on this to create images for quite a few projects over the years. The [Design Week book cover](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/archive/10/) was created using PostScript as were the [Kingston University posters](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/archive/8/).\n\nI’ve put the source for these into a small download. You’ll need Illustrator or some other PostScript viewer to see them.\n\n[\\[ZIP\\] Download PostScript examples](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/files/ps-examples.zip)\n\n#### Output from Flash into PostScript\n\nProbably the best use of PostScript from a modern designer/programmer’s perspective is as an intermediary format. With not much programming you can easily take output from Flash and get it into Illustrator.\n\n![generationpress.jpg](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/generationpress.jpg) \n\nFor the [Generation Press website](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/portfolio/generation-press/) I created a simple toy on the homepage which lets visitors generate their own pattern. It’s a nice example of something created in Flash which would look great as a high-resolution printout.\n\n#### Demo Application\n\nHere’s the toy wrapped into a demo application.\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" id=\"fm\\_application\\_117955304\" class=\"flashmovie\" width=\"440\" height=\"440\">  <object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/application.swf\" name=\"fm\\_application\\_117955304\" width=\"440\" height=\"440\"> \n\n[\\[ZIP\\] Download Source Code](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/files/ps-demo-app.zip)\n\nTo use, click to start drawing. Once the drawing has finished, click 'Show PostScript' to see the code. This code doesn't update live because Flash isn't fast enough, so wait until the drawing has finished before viewing it. All the application does is output the same drawing commands as PostScript-style commands into the text window;\n\n\\[as\\] this\\[\"output\"\\].lineTo(xp, yp); ps(xp+\" \"+yp+\" lineto\"); \\[/as\\]\n\nThe `ps()` function outputs the code to the text window;\n\n![ps-code-example.jpg](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/ps-code-example.jpg) \n\nNow you can copy and paste this code into a text editor. Save it with a '.ps' extension and then load into Illustrator:\n\n![ps-mockup.jpg](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/ps-mockup.jpg) \n\nThe image on the right is magnified to show that the drawing is made up of a series of small lines created by the `lineto` command in the PostScript code.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nSo that demonstrates the basic principle. PostScript is a very powerful language and you can do all kinds of other fun things with it, particularly when you start to redefine the built in `lineto` and `curveto` commands to do something else... but that's a story for another day.\n\n* [\\[PDF\\] PostScript Language Reference Manual, third edition](http://www.adobe.com/products/postscript/pdfs/PLRM.pdf)\n* [\\[ZIP\\] Download PostScript examples](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/files/ps-examples.zip)\n* [\\[ZIP\\] Download Source Code](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/files/ps-demo-app.zip)\n* [PostScript Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript) featuring some great resources and some fairly insane applications including an HTML renderer and ray tracer..."

A couple of years back I was creating some interactive sites using bouncing balls as navigation. These needed to behave in a believable manner so I spent some time looking at rigid body dynamics code.\n\n#### Rigid Body Dynamics\n\nThere are many approaches to solids-based simulation on a computer. The most realistic involve running a simulation in relatively large slices of time (say 1/60 second) until a collision occurs, and then ‘rewinding’ the simulation in smaller slices of time until the exact moment of impact. This ensures that no objects are ever seen to overlap, and the simulation then continues from the exact moment at which they touch. This is computationally intensive and a little overkill for what I wanted.\n\nThe second method is a little more ‘relaxed’ and doesn’t strive for perfection. You can get a reasonable result using springs to resolve collisions.\n\n#### Elastic Collision\n\nI already had some spring code so I hooked up a system as follows;\n\n![collision.gif](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/collision.gif) \n\nFigure 1 is a system with balls bouncing around under gravity. The system checks whether two balls overlap. Figure 2 shows what happens when two balls overlap. All we have to do is measure the overlap. We temporarily create a spring which is attached to the centre of each ball between a and b. \n\n![collision-2.gif](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/collision-2.gif)\n\nThe spring’s resting length is then set such that, when fully relaxed, it would allow the balls to touch exactly. This means that the spring is under compression; it tries its best to get back to its resting length and in doing so forces the balls apart as shown in Figure 3.\n\n#### Nervous Energy\n\nThis worked really well for what I needed as the balls bounce around nicely and it’s a lot of fun. However the lack of precision shows when you try and contain the balls too tightly. The system becomes a little unstable as the balls try to break free from each other but are constrained by the walls.\n\nHowever the same code is used the in [Magnetic example](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/work/flash-9-magnetic/) which is able to resolve itself as there is plenty of space for the balls to move into.\n\n#### Download\n\n[\\[ZIP\\] Download Elastic Collision source code](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/files/elastic-collision.zip)\n\n#### Example\n\nClick and drag to move the balls around\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" id=\"fm\\_springs\\_76817265\" class=\"flashmovie\" width=\"440\" height=\"440\">  <object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" data=\"http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/springs.swf\" name=\"fm\\_springs\\_76817265\" width=\"440\" height=\"440\">"

This can result in incomplete information handover and a loss of accountability. Examples of these confidential records are often found littered accidentally on the ground of the hospital car park.\n\n##### Bleeps and landlines\nThe existing system for managing and delegating tasks was via pagers (‘bleeps’) and landline phones. Receiving a bleep and then following up only later by landline is incredibly inefficient and leads to tasks not being actioned in a timely manner. There is no way to prioritise or delegate tasks and this could potentially lead to a dangerous situation.\n\n##### Zero to one MVP in 6 months\nThe practical challenge at the outset was to start from zero and deliver a testable MVP iPhone app within 6 months. Success in addressing the above would potentially unlock further funding to continue and extend the project further.\n"

The developer of the tool worked with me to adjust the input and output of the tool. Passing `--format json` causes standard output to be in JSON which is more easily consumed by software. \n\n```\n$ mykrobe_atlas predict\\\n    --sample MDR_1\\\n    --species tb\\\n    --seq /MDR_1.fastq.gz\\ \n    --format json\n```\n\nThe final prototype took the form of a fully signed app containing the command-line tool, proving that the front-end was able to communicate with the tool to analyse a sequence and then display the results to the end user. We were also able to build and run the same app on Linux and Windows, making it more attractive in terms of effort to build and maintain over the long term.\n\n##### Building the first product\nThe visual designs were next implemented in the prototype, with added animations added to the splash screen and simple transitions between screens adding to the charm. We added drag-and-drop support which means that with the final production app users can simply drag a DNA sequence file into the app and then view the results within a couple of minutes. \n\nThe product owner gave a memorable real-time demo of this in Mumbai which received many gasps with the audience wondering how this was possible.\n"

To realise this idea, I created a series of prototypes using static data in various types of force-directed graph visualisations and with different layout strategies. Following a cycle of team reviews and prototype refinements we eventually landed on a satisfying visualisation generated in the browser.\n\n##### Tree data structure\nI was then able to work with one of the back-end developers to arrive on a JSON data structure which could be generated dynamically via Neo4J.

This made it impossible to undertake the final pilot and user testing that we had planned.\n\nOne other problem was unique to this particular project - the technology is so advanced that none of our users were able to easily grasp what it could do or specifically what they might use it for. This meant we had to push the fidelity of our testable prototypes further than expected so that users would be able to engage with them in a useful way unlocking the necessary insight.\n\n##### Reflection\nWhat started out as a small identity and UI project eventually scaled into a multi-year multi-platform product. The other team members were humble, bright and inspiring and I learned so much about pathogens and diagnostics, as well as having my eyes opened to the realities of every day existence in other parts of the world. I am a named author on the research paper published in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10063) as an acknowledgment of my overall contribution.\n\nIt is still hard to believe that you can put a swab sample in a fancy USB stick then see a complete DNA analysis on your laptop screen within a couple of minutes.

This was conducted both in-person and remotely via screen sharing. \n\n##### Where is your stuff?\nOne key insight was that the first version of the site did not match many expert users mental model of the service. This group still thought of SPS as a document filing repository (one user even referred to navigation as ‘subfolders’). \n\nUsers from a wider group such as GPs and dentists had a pre-existing idea of what content was on the site and thought it would not meet their needs, in spite of it actually having a lot of relevant expert advice specifically tailored for them. \n\nFollowing this research we were able to compile evidence, recommendations and planning for solutions across four key areas: Navigating, Finding, Discovering and Content.\n"

We used a customised open-source CMS with a user-friendly admin interface. The documents and other resources were safe in one single place, but as a first version we did not know if the resulting service would be popular, or how it would be used.\n\n##### Second iteration\nAfter an initial bedding in period and following the workshop outlined above we uncovered several key insights. The service was well used, but users found it very difficult to find content or in fact really discovery what content was on offer by SPS. By now they were starting to publish more web-native HTML article content and starting to see the down-sides of their legacy Word and PDF documents. These legacy documents were hampering search and discoverability, as well as undermining user confidence in finding the most up-to-date material.\n\n##### Searching and finding\nBased on user research and observation, we changed the way that users were able to search and ‘drill down’ to find the specific content or themes they were interested in. This was achieved with a mixture of topic-based filtering and integrating search within site content and themes. This optimised the path for users who would first find a broad topic area they were looking for, then being able to search more specifically and easily within.\n"

Now that content was starting to be written using our HTML authoring tools we knew we would be more able to create themed collections of content as well as related articles.\n\nWe were able to rework the main index pages using themed blocks of content with an editorial hierarchy which is automated by default but completely customisable by authors. This created a powerful system which renders pages where it is easy to find themes and specific articles, and discover a wider range of what SPS has to offer.\n"
