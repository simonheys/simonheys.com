Obviously a job for\nSharedObject.\n\nHowever there is a trick to creating a SharedObject that behaves how you’d\nexpect.\n\nIf you’re like me, you would think the correct code is;\n\n```actionscript\nvar my_so:SharedObject; \nmy_so = SharedObject.getLocal(\"com.simonheys.screensavr\");\n```\n\nBut this results in a SharedObject which can only be accessed by the SWF\nthat created it…not what I wanted. The not-very-obvious solution is to add\na second parameter which is referred to simply as ‘localPath’ in the docs;\n\n\n```actionscript\nvar my_so:SharedObject; \nmy_so = SharedObject.getLocal(“com.simonheys.screensavr”,”/”);\n````\n\nThat’s it! You now have a useful SharedObject which you can access from\nany SWF on your machine. Having spent literally hours trying to track down\nthe solution I decided to write a nice preferences class in a similar\nstyle to the one I use in Cocoa. Applications usually have unique\npreferences, so this is customised for each one.\n\n```actionscript\nclass com.simonheys.projects.screensavr.ScreensavrPreferences {\n  public static var \n    PHOTOSTREAM:Number = 0, \n    PHOTOSET:Number = 1, \n    GROUP:Number = 2, \n    FAVOURITES:Number = 3;\n\n  public var\n    useHighQuality:Boolean,\n    username:String, \n    sourceType:Number,\n    sourceId:String, \n    speed:Number;\n\n  private var \n    _soId:String;\n\n  public function setSharedObjectId(soId:String):Void { \n    _soId = soId;\n  } \n\n  public function storeInSharedObject():Void { \n    var my_so:SharedObject = SharedObject.getLocal(_soId,”/”);\n    my_so.data.username = username;\n    my_so.data.sourceType = sourceType;\n    my_so.data.sourceId = sourceId;\n    my_so.data.speed = speed;\n    my_so.data.useHighQuality = useHighQuality;\n    my_so.flush();\n  } \n\n  public function retreiveFromSharedObject():Void { \n    var my_so:SharedObject = SharedObject.getLocal(_soId,”/”);\n    username = my_so.data.username;\n    sourceType = my_so.data.sourceType;\n    sourceId = my_so.data.sourceId;\n    speed = my_so.data.speed;\n    useHighQuality = my_so.data.useHighQuality;\n  } \n}\n````\n\nI did think about having methods called ‘save’ and ‘load’ but was\nobviously feeling verbose that day. You could of course have this as a\nSingleton in Flash, but I didn’t need to.\n\nThe code for using the prefs is then as simple as this:\n\n```actionscript\n_preferences = new ScreensavrPreferences();\n_preferences.setSharedObjectId(Constants.SHARED_OBJECT_ID);\n_preferences.retreiveFromSharedObject();\n\n// retrieve a value\nhighQualityCheckBox.selected = _preferences.useHighQuality;\n\n// store a value \n_preferences.sourceType = ScreensavrPreferences.PHOTOSTREAM;\n\n_preferences.storeInSharedObject();\n```\n\nWhere `Constants.SHARED_OBJECT_ID` is something like `com.simonheys.preferences.screensavr`.\n"

The first one is the [Vector Field\ndemo](/work/vector-field-example/)\nI wrote ages ago.\n\n#### First, the source code\n\n[Download Vector Field source code](/files/vectorfield.zip)\n\nIt’s easy to change the size, colour and ‘splat’ graphics. This is totally\nfree for non-commercial use, but I kindly ask that you contact me if you\nwish to use it for something commercial.\n\nPart of the reason I’m posting this is because it has a bug which I can’t\nfigure out how to fix. To explain what the bug is I need to explain how\nthis works. So here goes.\n\n#### Vector Fields and fluids\n\nAt some point last year I wanted to create a fluid / liquid simulation and\nhad been looking at [Vector\nFields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector%5Ffield) and their use in\nfluid simulations. These work by having a huge matrix of vectors, the\ndirection of which are controlled by the fluid algorithm. Here’s a very\nsimple example:\n\n\n![field.gif](uploads/2007/06/field.gif)\n\n\nEach vector in the field has two components, one for the horizontal\nmovement x, and another for the vertical movement y. A 3d field would have\na third component, z.\n\n\nParticles or colour or whatever is required to turn this into a\nvisualisation are moved around according to the vector field. If there is\na particle on top of the vector shown above then it will move 0.5 units\nalong x and 0.45 along y. If a force is applied to disturb the liquid then\nsome of the vectors would correspondingly increase in magnitude. Scale\nthis up to a larger system and you have the basics of a fluid simulation. \n\n\nThis is an enormous amount of computation, and even for a tiny area of\n100×100 pixels you’d need 10,000 vectors. This seemed totally beyond the\nscope of Flash 8 which is still sluggish in math performance compared to\nFlash 9 or Java.\n\n\n#### Vector Fields and DisplacementMap\n\n\nThen I started playing around with DisplacementMaps. I’d seen various\ndemo’s of the [3d spinning\nglobe](http://nodename.com/blog/2006/01/16/psyarks-displacementmapfilter-tutorial/)\nvariety and was intrigued as to how it was done, particularly as the\ndisplacement map never looked, on the surface at least, to have much\nbearing on what actually happens.\n\n\nThankfully it’s all much simpler than the Flash documentation led me to\nbelieve. Displacement maps have two channels – one controlling horizontal\nmovement and the other controlling vertical movement. This was starting to\nsound familiar:\n\n\n![field2.gif](uploads/2007/06/field2.gif)\n\n\nHallelujah! A DisplacementMap is effectively a huge array of vectors, and\nperfect for a fluid simulation. There’s a small amount of math that\nconverts between the component value of each colour channel and the\ncorresponding x or y movement;\n\n\n```actionscript\ndstPixel[x, y] = srcPixel[ \n  x + ((componentX(x, y) – 128) * scaleX) / 256, \n  y + ((componentY(x, y) – 128) * scaleY) / 256\n];\n````\n\nI spent ages staring at this line of code, but it’s really easy. Taking\nthe horizontal channel as an example: a value of 128 doesn’t move at all;\nless than 128 would move left and more than 128 would move right. You\nspecify a scale value when creating the DisplacementMap that controls the\nmagnitude of movement in either direction.\n\n\nI quickly wrote this demo and was very pleased with the result, especially\nthe nice surprise of the colours mixing together. It’s really simple;\nthere is a displacement map, and a brush like the soft brush in PhotoShop.\nWhen you drag with the mouse the code calculates the corresponding colour\nfor that movement and paints onto the displacement map. This causes\nfluid-like movement:\n\n\n#### And now, the bug\n\n\nWhen you play with the code you will notice that occasionally you get\n‘dead pixels’ in the liquid. I find this intensely annoying. I have tried\nseveral fixes but have yet to solve it. Here’s what you see:\n\n\n![swirl-grr.jpg](uploads/2007/06/swirl-grr.jpg)\n\n\nGrrr. At first I thought it would just be a case of using a threshold call\nto change all elements with a value of 128,128 (ie. not moving) into\nsomething else. But it doesn’t work because the real problem is when you\nhave two pixels next to each other which are pointing in opposing\ndirections, canceling each other out. So I also tried a Gaussian blur, but\nthis has a weird effect where the whole movement shifts off balance and\ntends towards the bottom-right.\n\n\nI am out of ideas on this one and am hoping someone else can think of nice\na workaround.\n\n\nAll ideas welcome.\n"

I think it’s a hidden gem. Not only is it a fascinating [programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript#The%5Flanguage) which can be used to create generative drawings and save you hours of time through automation, but you can also use it as an intermediary format to transfer output from other languages such as Flash ActionScript or Java / Processing into Adobe Illustrator.\n\n#### A simple PostScript program\n\nCopy and paste this into a text editor (NotePad or TextEdit), save it as ‘simple.ps’ and then open it in Illustrator.\n\n```postscript\n%!PS-Adobe-3.0 \n\n0 0 moveto\n100 100 lineto\nstroke\n\nshowpage\n```\n\nThis little snippet gives the following result:\n\n![ps-line.gif](uploads/2007/06/ps-line.gif) \n\nA line from 0,0 to 100,100. Amazing, eh? Not really, but the point is that the code is really simple to understand and we’re only using the line drawing command. If you go slow and learn one command at a time, you can eventually do some pretty interesting and useful things.\n\n#### Learning PostScript\n\nThere are  lots of PostScript tutorials on the web that will explain the basic concepts. One thing to note is that PostScript is [stack based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming) which means you push numbers onto the stack before operating on them. In raw code it makes it look like you’re doing things backwards and can seem off-putting. In practise it’s very simple and logical.\n\nThe essential guide to PostScript is the PLRM or ‘red book’. I bought a copy of this years ago and it’s pretty big at 800 pages! But thanks to the generosity of Adobe you can now download it online;\n\n[PostScript Language Reference Manual, third edition](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/actionscript/articles/PLRM.pdf)\n\n#### A lot, for a little\n\nOnce you’ve learned a few commands you’ll be able to achieve a lot with very little. Here’s something more advanced using a for-loop in conjunction with graphics transformation;\n\n\n```postscript\n%!PS-Adobe-3.0 \n\n0.75 setlinewidth\n0.75 setgray\n\n0 3 360 {\n  newpath\n  gsave\n  0 0 moveto\n  rotate\n  100 0 rlineto\n  stroke\n  grestore\n} for\n\nshowpage\n```\n\n\nProduces the following result: \n\n![picture-4.gif](uploads/2007/06/picture-4.gif) \n\nWhich is starting to look a bit more interesting, and like something that might be tricky to create purely ‘by hand’ in Illustrator. I’ve used techniques based on this to create images for quite a few projects over the years. The [Design Week book cover](/archive/10/) was created using PostScript as were the [Kingston University posters](/archive/8/).\n\nI’ve put the source for these into a small download. You’ll need Illustrator or some other PostScript viewer to see them.\n\n[Download PostScript examples](/files/ps-examples.zip)\n\n#### Output from Flash into PostScript\n\nProbably the best use of PostScript from a modern designer/programmer’s perspective is as an intermediary format. With not much programming you can easily take output from Flash and get it into Illustrator.\n\n![generationpress.jpg](uploads/2007/06/generationpress.jpg) \n\nFor the [Generation Press website](/portfolio/generation-press/) I created a simple toy on the homepage which lets visitors generate their own pattern. It’s a nice example of something created in Flash which would look great as a high-resolution printout.\n\n#### Demo Application\n\nHere’s the toy wrapped into a demo application.\n\n```\n<object classid=\\\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\\\" id=\\\"fm\\\\_application\\\\_117955304\\\" class=\\\"flashmovie\\\" width=\\\"440\\\" height=\\\"440\\\">\n<object type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" data=\\\"uploads/2007/06/application.swf\\\" name=\\\"fm\\\\_application\\\\_117955304\\\" width=\\\"440\\\" height=\\\"440\\\">\n```\n\n[Download Source Code](/files/ps-demo-app.zip)\n\nTo use, click to start drawing. Once the drawing has finished, click 'Show PostScript' to see the code. This code doesn't update live because Flash isn't fast enough, so wait until the drawing has finished before viewing it. All the application does is output the same drawing commands as PostScript-style commands into the text window;\n\n```actionscript\nthis[\"output\"].lineTo(xp, yp); \nps(xp+\" \"+yp+\" lineto\");\n```\n\nThe `ps()` function outputs the code to the text window!\n\n![ps-code-example.jpg](uploads/2007/06/ps-code-example.jpg)\n\nNow you can copy and paste this code into a text editor. Save it with a '.ps' extension and then load into Illustrator:\n\n![ps-mockup.jpg](uploads/2007/06/ps-mockup.jpg) \n\nThe image on the right is magnified to show that the drawing is made up of a series of small lines created by the `lineto` command in the PostScript code.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nSo that demonstrates the basic principle. PostScript is a very powerful language and you can do all kinds of other fun things with it, particularly when you start to redefine the built in `lineto` and `curveto` commands to do something else... but that's a story for another day.\n\n* [PostScript Language Reference Manual, third edition](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/actionscript/articles/PLRM.pdf)\n* [Download PostScript examples](/files/ps-examples.zip)\n* [Download Source Code](/files/ps-demo-app.zip)\n* [PostScript Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript) featuring some great resources and some fairly insane applications including an HTML renderer and ray tracer...\"\n"

A couple of years back I was creating some interactive sites using\nbouncing balls as navigation. These needed to behave in a believable\nmanner so I spent some time looking at rigid body dynamics code.\n\n#### Rigid Body Dynamics\n\nThere are many approaches to solids-based simulation on a computer. The\nmost realistic involve running a simulation in relatively large slices of\ntime (say 1/60 second) until a collision occurs, and then ‘rewinding’ the\nsimulation in smaller slices of time until the exact moment of impact.\nThis ensures that no objects are ever seen to overlap, and the simulation\nthen continues from the exact moment at which they touch. This is\ncomputationally intensive and a little overkill for what I wanted.\n\nThe second method is a little more ‘relaxed’ and doesn’t strive for\nperfection. You can get a reasonable result using springs to resolve\ncollisions.\n\n#### Elastic Collision\n\nI already had some spring code so I hooked up a system as follows;\n\n![collision.gif](uploads/2007/07/collision.gif) \n\nFigure 1 is a system with balls bouncing around under gravity. The system\nchecks whether two balls overlap. Figure 2 shows what happens when two\nballs overlap. All we have to do is measure the overlap. We temporarily\ncreate a spring which is attached to the centre of each ball between a and\nb. \n\n![collision-2.gif](uploads/2007/07/collision-2.gif)\n\nThe spring’s resting length is then set such that, when fully relaxed, it\nwould allow the balls to touch exactly. This means that the spring is\nunder compression; it tries its best to get back to its resting length and\nin doing so forces the balls apart as shown in Figure 3.\n\n#### Nervous Energy\n\nThis worked really well for what I needed as the balls bounce around\nnicely and it’s a lot of fun. However the lack of precision shows when you\ntry and contain the balls too tightly. The system becomes a little\nunstable as the balls try to break free from each other but are\nconstrained by the walls.\n\nHowever the same code is used the in [Magnetic\nexample](/work/flash-9-magnetic/)\nwhich is able to resolve itself as there is plenty of space for the balls\nto move into.\n\n#### Download\n\n[Download Elastic Collision source\ncode](/files/elastic-collision.zip)\n\n#### Example\n\nClick and drag to move the balls around\n\n```\n<object classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"\nid=\"fm\\_springs\\_76817265\" class=\"flashmovie\" width=\"440\" height=\"440\"> \n<object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"\ndata=\"uploads/2007/07/springs.swf\"\nname=\"fm\\_springs\\_76817265\" width=\"440\" height=\"440\">\n```\n"

          "type": "blog",
          "content": "In this post I show an easy way to interact with any Ethereum-compatible blockchain using TypeScript and Node.js. \n\n#### Why?\n\nI have recently been developing an app that interacts with an Ethereum blockchain and was expecting it to be incredibly complicated. But it’s not.\n\nHere is the surprisingly simple setup. All we need are three things:\n\n- [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/) - a library for interacting with Ethereum nodes\n- [Infura](https://infura.io/) - a service providing access to Ethereum nodes\n- An Ethereum-compatible wallet address (e.g. from [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/))\n\nFirst we will sign up for a [free Infura account](https://infura.io/register), then create a new project from the [Infura dashboard](https://infura.io/dashboard). This gives a Project ID which we will use to access the Ethereum node API.\n\n#### Set up the project folder\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir get-balance\n$ cd get-balance\n```\n\n#### Add dependencies\n\nWe are going to use TypeScript and `ts-node` which require a little bit of extra setup but a big pay-off in helping with code correctness.\n\n```bash\n$ yarn add typescript ts-node ethers @tsconfig/node16\n```\n\n#### Configure TypeScript\n\nCreate a file called `tsconfig.json` with the following configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extends\": \"@tsconfig/node16/tsconfig.json\",\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"lib\": [\"es2015\", \"dom\"],\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Create the script\n\nCreate a file called `index.ts` with the following script, replacing the Infura Project ID and wallet address where indicated:\n\n```typescript\nimport { ethers } from \"ethers\";\n\n// Replace with a project ID from [Infura](https://infura.io/)\nconst INFURA_PROJECT_ID = \"REPLACE_WITH_INFURA_PROJECT_ID\";\n\n// Replace with an Ethereum-compatible wallet address\nconst WALLET_ADDRESS = \"0xREPLACE_WITH_WALLET_ADDRESS\";\n\nconst fetchBalance = async () => {\n  // Create an ethers provider using Infura Mainnet\n  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(\n    `https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/${INFURA_PROJECT_ID}`\n  );\n\n  // Fetch the balance, this will be in Wei\n  const balanceInWei = await provider.getBalance(WALLET_ADDRESS);\n\n  // Convert balance to Eth\n  const balanceInEth = ethers.utils.formatEther(balanceInWei);\n\n  // Print a summary to the console\n  console.log(`Address: ${WALLET_ADDRESS}`);\n  console.log(`- balance in Wei: ${balanceInWei}`);\n  console.log(`- balance in ETH: ${balanceInEth}`);\n};\n\n(async () => {\n  await fetchBalance();\n})();\n\n```\n\n#### Get the balance\n\nWe can now run the script:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn ts-node index.ts\n```\n\n… an should expect the following output to the console:\n\n```bash\nAddress: 0x****************************************\n- balance in Wei: 214066444119271200\n- balance in ETH: 0.2140664441192712\n```\n\n#### That’s it\n\nThat is all there is to it, but read on for a bit more of a code breakdown and examples of using other Layer 2 chains.\n\n#### Code breakdown\n\nThere are a few concepts to break down:\n\n```typescript\nconst provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(\n  `https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/${INFURA_PROJECT_ID}`\n);\n```\n\nThis is creating a `provider` using Infura Mainnet, the main Ethereum blockchain. There are [other test networks available](https://docs.infura.io/infura/networks/ethereum/getting-started/make-requests).\n\nEthers has a specific Infura provider however we will use `JsonRpcProvider` as it is more generic. \n \nFor example with one small change we can now also query a balance on the Layer 2 [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) network by changing just the RPC:\n\n```typescript\nconst provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(\n  `https://polygon-rpc.com/`\n);\n```\n\n…or any other Layer 2 chain, e.g. [Gnosis Beacon Chain](https://www.gnosischain.com/)\n\n```typescript\nconst provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(\n  `https://rpc.gnosischain.com/`\n);\n```\n\nOnce we have the `provider` we use it to fetch the raw balance in [Wei](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/#denominations) which is the smallest unit.\n\n```typescript\nconst balanceInWei = await provider.getBalance(WALLET_ADDRESS);\n// Wei: 214066444119271200\n```\n\nThankfully ethers provides a convenient way to convert this to more familiar ETH:\n\n```typescript\nconst balanceInEth = ethers.utils.formatEther(balanceInWei);\n// Eth: 0.2140664441192712\n```\n\n#### Summary\n\nIn this post we learned an easy way to interact with any Ethereum blockchain using TypeScript and Node.js. We fetched a balance from an Ethereum-compatible wallet address by using [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/) (a library for interacting with Ethereum nodes) and [Infura](https://infura.io/) (a service providing access to Ethereum nodes).\n\nWe also learned how to connect to other Layer 2 chains directly such as [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) and [Gnosis Beacon Chain](https://www.gnosischain.com/) and use the same method to fetch a balance.\n\nFinally we learned how to convert the balance from Wei into ETH.\n\nThis gives the basic building blocks and a starting point for interacting with any Ethereum blockchain.\n"

Examples of these confidential records are often found littered accidentally on the ground of the hospital car park.\n\n##### Bleeps and landlines\nThe existing system for managing and delegating tasks was via pagers (‘bleeps’) and landline phones. Receiving a bleep and then following up only later by landline is incredibly inefficient and leads to tasks not being actioned in a timely manner. There is no way to prioritise or delegate tasks and this could potentially lead to a dangerous situation.\n\n##### Zero to one MVP in 6 months\nThe practical challenge at the outset was to start from zero and deliver a testable MVP iPhone app within 6 months. Success in addressing the above would potentially unlock further funding to continue and extend the project further.\n"

The developer of the tool worked with me to adjust the input and output of the tool. Passing `--format json` causes standard output to be in JSON which is more easily consumed by software. \n\n```\n$ mykrobe_atlas predict\\\n    --sample MDR_1\\\n    --species tb\\\n    --seq /MDR_1.fastq.gz\\ \n    --format json\n```\n\nThe final prototype took the form of a fully signed app containing the command-line tool, proving that the front-end was able to communicate with the tool to analyse a sequence and then display the results to the end user. We were also able to build and run the same app on Linux and Windows, making it more attractive in terms of effort to build and maintain over the long term.\n\n##### Building the first product\nThe visual designs were next implemented in the prototype, with added animations added to the splash screen and simple transitions between screens adding to the charm. We added drag-and-drop support which means that with the final production app users can simply drag a DNA sequence file into the app and then view the results within a couple of minutes. \n\nThe product owner gave a memorable real-time demo of this in Mumbai which received many gasps with the audience wondering how this was possible.\n"

Following a cycle of team reviews and prototype refinements we eventually landed on a satisfying visualisation generated in the browser.\n\n##### Tree data structure\nI was then able to work with one of the back-end developers to arrive on a JSON data structure which could be generated dynamically via Neo4J.

This made it impossible to undertake the final pilot and user testing that we had planned.\n\nOne other problem was unique to this particular project - the technology is so advanced that none of our users were able to easily grasp what it could do or specifically what they might use it for. This meant we had to push the fidelity of our testable prototypes further than expected so that users would be able to engage with them in a useful way unlocking the necessary insight.\n\n##### Reflection\nWhat started out as a small identity and UI project eventually scaled into a multi-year multi-platform product. The other team members were humble, bright and inspiring and I learned so much about pathogens and diagnostics, as well as having my eyes opened to the realities of every day existence in other parts of the world. I am a named author on the research paper published in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10063) as an acknowledgment of my overall contribution.\n\nIt is still hard to believe that you can put a swab sample in a fancy USB stick then see a complete DNA analysis on your laptop screen within a couple of minutes.

We used a customised open-source CMS with a user-friendly admin interface. The documents and other resources were safe in one single place, but as a first version we did not know if the resulting service would be popular, or how it would be used.\n\n##### Second iteration\nAfter an initial bedding in period and following the workshop outlined above we uncovered several key insights. The service was well used, but users found it very difficult to find content or in fact really discovery what content was on offer by SPS. By now they were starting to publish more web-native HTML article content and starting to see the down-sides of their legacy Word and PDF documents. These legacy documents were hampering search and discoverability, as well as undermining user confidence in finding the most up-to-date material.\n\n##### Searching and finding\nBased on user research and observation, we changed the way that users were able to search and ‘drill down’ to find the specific content or themes they were interested in. This was achieved with a mixture of topic-based filtering and integrating search within site content and themes. This optimised the path for users who would first find a broad topic area they were looking for, then being able to search more specifically and easily within.\n"
