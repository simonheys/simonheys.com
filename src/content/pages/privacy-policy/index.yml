      This page explains what information is collected when you visit [simonheys.com](https://www.simonheys.com/), how it is used, and how you can contact me with questions.

      ## Who is responsible

      This website is run by **Studio Heys Limited**, 143 Pancras Road, London NW1 1UN.

      You can contact me at [si@simonheys.com](mailto:si@simonheys.com).

      ## What data is collected when you visit the site

      When you browse the site, some technical information is automatically collected, such as:

      * your IP address and basic device/browser details (via standard web server logs)
      * the pages you visit and when you visit them
      * referrer information (how you arrived at the site)

      This information is used to keep the site secure and to understand aggregate usage patterns. It is not used to personally identify you.

      ## Analytics and performance

      The site uses [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) and [Vercel Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/speed-insights) to measure traffic and performance.

      These tools collect anonymised or pseudonymous usage data, such as page views, device type and approximate location, to help me understand how the site is used and where to improve performance.

      I do not use advertising, marketing or social media tracking cookies, and I do not build profiles of individual visitors or track you across other websites.

      ## Cookies

      The site itself does not set any cookies beyond what is strictly necessary for basic operation. Vercel's analytics tools may use first-party cookies or similar technologies as described in their own documentation.

      You can control or delete cookies at any time using your browser settings.

      ## When you contact me

      If you email me via links on this site, I will receive the information you choose to send (such as your name, email address and message). Emails are stored in my email provider and used only to respond to your enquiry or maintain our ongoing correspondence.

      ## Retention

      Server logs and analytics data are retained for a limited period to monitor usage and security, in line with Vercel's defaults. Email correspondence may be kept longer where needed for ongoing work or to comply with legal obligations.

      ## Your rights

      Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct or delete personal data I hold about you. If you would like to exercise these rights, contact me at [si@simonheys.com](mailto:si@simonheys.com).

      ## Changes to this policy

      This policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.
