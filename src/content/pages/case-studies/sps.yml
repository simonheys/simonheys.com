      # Creating a public sector service that draws together professional advice for pharmacists, GPs and clinicians
      I was Lead Product Designer in a cross-disciplinary team on a project spanning 7 years, helping to drive and influence product decisions and strategy while thinking like a tax payer.

      ##### This service does not (yet) exist
      Following a successful procurement I was part of a the team tasked with transforming four distinct services into a new single entity, delivering a single digital platform for communication speaking as part of NHS England.

      ##### Where is our stuff?
      The four distinct services had an existing repository of high quality content, unfortunately dispersed throughout 17 different protected systems. 

      ##### Evolving structures and hierarchies
      The first practical challenge would be to gather the existing material together into one place, then make sure it is easily findable with some structure and hierarchy that would be able to evolve over time as the service evolves.

      ##### “It mustn’t look expensive”
      During some of our early conversations and workshops it became clear that we must be respectful to the taxpayer, everything should be frugal and deliver maximum possible value. In terms of aesthetics this ruled out the use of any imagery, instead the challenge was to focus only on competent use of typography, space and hierarchy.

      ##### Who are we?
      As a brand new service bringing together different stakeholders for the first time, it was important to join the dots and establish a shared vision. We ran a lightweight vision and values workshop during which  the team established their purpose, vision, tone of voice and strap-line. We identified a range of potential users that would provide insight to shape the first version of the service.

      ##### Zero to one
      For the very first version of the site we commissioned an approved gov.uk UX agency to undertake the extremely time consuming task of interviewing a range of stakeholders and potential users. This gave an initial site map and structure which we used for launch.

      ##### Regular user research
      After allowing the initial site to grow its audience we began to establish a regular working pattern of user testing to understand pain points and validate solutions. This was conducted both in-person and remotely via screen sharing. 
      
      ##### Where is your stuff?
      One key insight was that the first version of the site did not match many expert users mental model of the service. This group still thought of SPS as a document filing repository (one user even referred to navigation as ‘subfolders’). 
      
      Users from a wider group such as GPs and dentists had a pre-existing idea of what content was on the site and thought it would not meet their needs, in spite of it actually having a lot of relevant expert advice specifically tailored for them. 
      
      Following this research we were able to compile evidence, recommendations and planning for solutions across four key areas: Navigating, Finding, Discovering and Content.

      ##### Where are we going?
      A second workshop was provided an opportunity to bring a range of people from all levels of the service together to share experiences and understand whether their aspirations for the service had changed since launch. We conducted a range of exercises to find out.       
      
      ##### How will we get there?
      The outputs of the workshops were combined with the results of the most recent user research to form a short, medium and long-term roadmap for the service.
