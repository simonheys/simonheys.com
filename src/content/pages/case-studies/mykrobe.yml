      ### A product with charm
      I was initially approached to create an identity and user interface for a family of digital diagnostic tools which are able to identify Tuberculosis (TB) species and antibiotic resistance. 
      
      The goal was to make the existing command-line products usable and appealing to non-specialist users. I was asked to create a product with charm.

    subtitle: |
      ### No internet? No problem
      The target users are non-specialist and non-technical nurses who may sometimes be working in remote areas, often using laptops and sometimes with no internet connection. This meant the solution had to be something that could be downloaded and then used offline.

      ### Turning a TB sample into action
      All users would have access to digital DNA sequence files generated by lab-based sequencing machines, with some having early access to pioneering USB-stick sequencer from Oxford Nanopore. 

      Given their sequence file, these users want to quickly know if and what strain of TB their sample contains, and if so what antibiotics it is likely susceptible to. This informs a potential course of treatment and gives an indication if there is a possible outbreak. 

      Therefore the solution would hide away all technical complexity behind the scenes, presenting clear and actionable information to the user to inform further action.

      ### UK-based users…
      I and other members of the team undertook user interviews and research initially in the UK, speaking to experts at Oxford University, Genomics England and The European Bioinformatics Institute. This was useful in informing what types of diagnostic information would be most suitable.

      ### …are not representative of all users
      However it became clear that these UK-based users were only representative of a particularly expert subset of the target user base. The project started to generate interest in India and I was part of a small team that undertook a field trip to TB-prevalent areas of Mumbai. We are able to visit a range of sites and talk to a range of potential users working in every situation, from dedicated hospitals to temporary mobile labs.

      ### Adapting the product to fit
      We were able to observe and capture existing workflows to help understand where we could adapt our product to fit seamlessly into day-to-day operations.

    title: Solution
    subtitle: |
      ### Start at the beginning
      I started with a lightweight identity design exercise where we arrived at a solution that satisfied the requirements for charm and animation by using simple forms in a bold and colourful way. The visual language was derived from images of lab samples. 

      ### Planning the initial solution
      The next logical step was to agree on the content and screens for an initial solution. This was achieved using a mixture of screen mapping coupled with low-fidelity wireframes which contained the information derived from the command-line tool which dictated the feature-set. 

      ### Extending the visual language
      The identity and visual language could then be applied to the wireframes. We reached agreement on a solution which was visually clean and easy to read, while incorporating charm via touches of animation and iconography.

      ### Finding the technology
      The requirement to work offline and be cross-platform led to a discussion of possible technical solutions such as building multiple clients or using QT, both of which would carry a large initial cost plus ongoing maintenance burden. Since the interface is largely text-based I suggested it might be a good candidate for a relatively new technology called Electron, which provides a way to develop an application with a browser-based user interface which also works offline.

      ### Proving the technology
      I created an initial prototype with the goal of having the minimum set of features required to prove Electron as a solution. The developer of the tool worked with me to adjust the input and output of the tool into JSON which is more easily consumed by software. The final prototype took the form of a fully signed app containing the command-line tool, proving that the front-end was able to communicate with the tool to analyse a sequence and then display the results to the end user. We were also able to build and run the same app on Linux and Windows, making it more attractive in terms of effort to build and maintain over the long term.

      ### Building the first product
      The visual designs were next implemented in the prototype, with added animations added to the splash screen and simple transitions between screens adding to the charm. We added drag-and-drop support which means that with the final production app users can simply drag a DNA sequence file into the app and then view the results within a couple of minutes. 

      The team lead gave a real-time demo of this in Mumbai which received many gasps and a round of applause.

      ### Turning a product into a platform
      The initial app was well received by end users and this played a small part in the overall project securing further funding. The vision was extended to create not just a standalone app, but a whole online platform that would allow users to create their own secure online library of sequence data, with potential to collaborate anonymously with others to identify similar samples and potential outbreaks.

      We used what we had learned from users in Mumbai to map out the first iteration of the platform. Wireframes were not easily relatable to our end users, so we took the extra step to create fully realised screens before conducting user testing. This gave us much higher engagement and better feedback from our target users, allowing us to iterate and refine the target product state.

      ### Complex visualisations
      One of the most challenging parts of the platform from a product design perspective is visualising the relatedness of different samples. This was initially achieved using a phylogenetic tree.

      One of the more scientific team members came up with a better solution using a kind of hand-drawn node graph which has a significantly lower density of data making it easier to read. To realise this idea, I created a series of prototypes using static data in various types of force-directed graph visualisations and with different layout strategies. Following a cycle of team reviews and prototype refinements we eventually landed on a satisfying visualisation generated in the browser.

      ### Tree data structure
      I was then able to work with one of the back-end developers to arrive on a JSON data structure which could be generated dynamically via Neo4J. The resulting visualisation replaced the phylogenetic tree.

      ### Web and desktop platform
      The final design works across both the offline desktop app and the web-based platform.

      ### Design system
      I worked with other front-end engineers to build the user interface using React and Redux with the component design system documented live in Storybooks. I re-worked the Electron app to use the same components, giving a consistent appearance and reducing the effort required for ongoing maintenance. 
      
      ### Front to back
      We worked closely with the back-end developers against an OpenAPI spec, with some realtime events using SSE.

      ### TB, meet COVID-19
      While we were focused on preparing the platform for its first real-world pilot in Argentina, something called COVID-19 stole the news agenda. Many TB labs were forced to change their focus to analysing COVID-19 during the pandemic, making the planned pilot impossible. The platform has since seen renewed interest from a very large global technology firm, and will be migrated onto their platform where it can be scaled to be used for COVID-19 surveillance alongside TB.

      ### Reflection
      What started out as a small identity and UI project eventually scaled into a multi-year multi-platform product. The other team members were humble, bright and inspiring and I learned so much about pathogens and diagnostics, as well as having my eyes opened to the realities of every day existence in other parts of the world. 
      
      It is still hard to believe that you can put a swab sample in a fancy USB stick then see a complete DNA analysis on your laptop screen within a couple of minutes. It was an honour and privilege to work with people who make such breakthroughs possible.
