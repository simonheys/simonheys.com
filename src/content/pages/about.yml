      I am an experienced graphic designer and developer. The combination of high fluency in both fields enables me to invent, prototype and develop digital products, tools and services for iOS, macOS and the web.

      Most recently I was Creative Director and Co-Founder of digital agency Make+Ship. Prior to that I was in-house designer and developer at The Guardian, UBS and The Times.

      It is in my nature to make and craft things with attention to quality and detail. I always enjoy the journey starting from nothing to creating something useful, enjoyable or inspiring to others.
