      I am an experienced freelance designer and developer with a passion for making and crafting digital products, tools and services that are useful, empowering or inspiring to others.

      Most recently I was co-founder of a digital agency which designed and developed a range of apps, tools and services for organisations and startups in healthcare. Prior to that I worked in-house as a designer and developer at The Guardian, The Times, UBS Investment Bank and more. 

      I hold a BA (Hons) in Communication Design (First with Commendation for Typography) from Kingston University London.

      I am available to design and develop apps or websites and always interested in talking about new projects or roles â€” please get in touch.
