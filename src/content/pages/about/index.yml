    subtitle: |
      I am an experienced [Product Designer](/portfolio) and [Software Engineer](https://github.com/simonheys/) with a passion for making and crafting digital products, tools and services that are useful, empowering or inspiring to others. 

      I am most well known for my side projects [Word Clock](/portfolio/wordclock) (exhibited at the [Science Museum](https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/) in London), and [Minimal Folio](/portfolio/minimalfolio) (installed by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) as a demo app in high street Apple Stores).

      Most recently I co-founded a digital agency where I was part of [many cross-disciplinary teams](/case-studies) that designed and developed apps, tools and services for organisations and startups in healthcare. One of the resulting products was acquired by [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/). 

      Prior to that I worked in-house as a Product Designer at [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/), [The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/), and [UBS Investment Bank](https://www.ubs.com/).

      I hold a BA (Hons) in Communication Design (First with Commendation for Typography) from [Kingston University London](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/).
