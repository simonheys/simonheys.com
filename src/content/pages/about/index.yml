    title: About
    text: |
      I am an experienced Product Designer and Software Engineer with a passion for making and crafting digital products, tools and services that are useful, empowering or inspiring to others. 

      Most recently I was co-founder of a digital agency and was part of many cross-disciplinary teams that designed and developed apps, tools and services for organisations and startups in healthcare. One of the resulting products was acquired by Google DeepMind. 
      
      Prior to that I worked in-house as a Product Designer at The Guardian, The Times, and UBS Investment Bank.

      I hold a BA (Hons) in Communication Design (First with Commendation for Typography) from Kingston University London.
