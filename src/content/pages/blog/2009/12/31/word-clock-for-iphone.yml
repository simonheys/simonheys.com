      So I’ve spent my spare moments over the past year-and-a-bit working on
      [Word Clock for
      iPhone](http://itunes.apple.com/app/word-clock/id338480180?mt=8) (link
      opens iTunes). This uses the same languages as the screensaver and
      features linear and rotary versions with full typographic control. You can
      pinch and zoom and animate between the two versions.


      I’ve also set up a simple dedicated website. The idea is to eventually
      move all the Word Clock-related information and separate it from this
      blog. Hopefully I will then start writing about subjects other than the
      clock…
