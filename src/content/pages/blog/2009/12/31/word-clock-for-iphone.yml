      I’ve spent my spare moments over the past year-and-a-bit working on
      [Word Clock for
      iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/app/word-clock/id338480180?mt=8) (link

      features linear and rotary versions with full typographic control. You can
      pinch and zoom and animate between the two versions.


      I’ve also set up a simple dedicated website. The idea is to eventually
      move all the Word Clock-related information and separate it from this
      blog. Hopefully I will then start writing about subjects other than the
      clock…
