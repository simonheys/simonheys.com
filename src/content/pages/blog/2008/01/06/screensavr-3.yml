title: Screensavr
excerpt: |
  Two big improvements in this new alpha version: first it’s much less
  processor-intensive (now uses OpenGL), and second it stores the screen between
  sessions so it doesn’t have to start with an empty screen each time. Go to the
  new page to download. Please let me know by email if you have any problems.
