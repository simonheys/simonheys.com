      [tonic](http://www.tonic.co.uk/) I was recently working on a project for a
      client where we wanted to get across the idea of different teams working
      on individual projects. I came up with the idea of magnetic navigation,
      which attracts a different group of people appropriate to the selected
      project. There were a few ways of achieving this; the best one turned out
      to be using the [elastic
      collision](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/work/elastic-collision/)
      code, but adding attractive forces. There is a fair amount of mathematical
      calculation going on per frame. Flash 9 Alpha came out at around the same
      time, so out of curiosity I rewrote the initial ‘sketch’ concept in AS3\.
      Yields a massive speed increase! Requires [Adobe Flash 9
      plug-in](http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/). The site itself is
      Flash 8 and will be live early 2007.
