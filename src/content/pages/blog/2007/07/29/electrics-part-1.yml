      I am working on building a physical version of [Word
      Clock](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/wordclock/), from
      scratch, with electronics components. Here’s the first working circuit:


      I’ve been learning electronics from various books and all over the web.
      One of the best resources I’ve found is [Bowden’s Hobby
      Circuits](http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Bill%5FBowden/homepage.htm)
      which includes some lovely clock examples and circuits. This circuit is
      partially based on the 72-LED clock, but I’m using a very accurate crystal
      oscillator for the seconds pulse and a different approach to the startup
      sequence.


      Next stage is to build up the seconds, hours and minutes LEDs and add time
      setting functions.
