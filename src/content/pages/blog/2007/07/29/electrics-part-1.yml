      I am working on building a physical version of [Word Clock](/portfolio/wordclock/), from scratch, with electronics components. Here’s the first working circuit:

      I’ve been learning electronics from various books and all over the web. One of the best resources I’ve found is [Bowden’s Hobby Circuits](http://www.bowdenshobbycircuits.info/) which includes some lovely clock examples and circuits. This circuit is partially based on the 72-LED clock, but I’m using a very accurate crystal oscillator for the seconds pulse and a different approach to the startup sequence.

      Next stage is to build up the seconds, hours and minutes LEDs and add time setting functions.
