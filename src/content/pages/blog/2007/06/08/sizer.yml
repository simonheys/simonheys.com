      If you’re a print designer who regularly receives batches of digital
      artwork from various sources then this might save you a bit of time.


      This AppleScript batch processes folders of images (can also contain
      nested folders) and creates a report of image dimensions, resolution and
      colour, including what size each image would be at 300dpi. Here’s some
      example output:


      ![sizer](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/sizer1.gif
      "sizer")


      You can see that it also highlights where images are lower than 300dpi.


      Originally written for [jaypeg](http://thingstolookat.blogspot.com/) as a
      useful tool to help ascertain problems (e.g. images in the wrong colour
      space, or too low resolution) and also help determine which images might
      be suitable for printing at larger sizes.
