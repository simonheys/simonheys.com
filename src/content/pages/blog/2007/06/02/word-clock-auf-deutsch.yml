      Heart-felt thanks to the heroic [Ole Zorn](http://www.omz-software.de/en/)
      who volunteered to translate the clock into German, not realising that he
      was about to experience a grueling 3-day schedule of testing and
      round-the-clock correspondence. Thanks Ole!

      I now have a translation-ready clock. If you, or any of your kind friends
      are willing to do some translation then please [get in
      touch](mailto:si@simonheys.com). Now that Ole has been such a help, itâ€™s
      pretty easy\* to add other languages.


      You can see the German version by going to System Preferences >
      International and making German your preferred language. Note that you
      must have German language support installed for this to work. [Updated
      version now
