      "photo sharing") 


      I’ve been making blue-prints / cyanotypes of various kinds for quite a
      while. The appeal has always been to make photos without using lenses or
      carefully controlled photographic processes. I’ve never been a big fan of
      photography; the equipment and techniques are now so honed and precise
      leading the majority of photographs to appear somewhat mechanical and
      soul-less. I want the surprise of the accidental rather than the boredom
      of the deliberate. 


      I originally bought the base chemicals from the excellent
      [Silverprint](http://www.silverprint.co.uk/) in Waterloo but used them up
      long ago. Inspired by the recent sunny weather I thought I’d try one of
      their [alternative process
      kits](http://www.silverprint.co.uk/altproc9.html) which includes various
      bits and pieces like a measuring cup, syringe and coating rods which make
      the job that much easier. Rather than the usual contact prints with plants
      or [other stuff](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/archive/22/), I
      thought it might be interesting to try a pinhole camera. 


      Of course since the kit arrived the sun has gone into hiding and
      consequently I’ve not been able to make much progress. This was an
      exposure I took yesterday. I couldn’t class it as a photograph at all, but
      I like the way it turned out all the same.
