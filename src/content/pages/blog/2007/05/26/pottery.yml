      To use: draw a simple ‘S’ shape on the left-hand panel. Then experiment.
      Note that it’s fairly crude and only renders convex surfaces properly.


      This was a quick mockup I made at the end of last year to try out an idea
      for a Christmas Card. It was originally going to be for making baubels,
      and would have the addition of automatic smoothing, concave rendering and
      mapping a christmassy texture onto the surface. Probably saving, galleries
      etc. might have followed.


      I like simple interactive toys like this, where you can understand what to
      do straight away and there’s an immediate reward and a sense of play.
