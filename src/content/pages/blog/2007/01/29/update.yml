title: Update
excerpt: |
  I just packed up the new version of Screensavr which I hacked together
  yesterday. Now automatically fills the screen, does different image
  proportions and can also read Groups. Next stage is to get it to honour all
  image proportions and handle different sized images. Then it shall be
  complete.
