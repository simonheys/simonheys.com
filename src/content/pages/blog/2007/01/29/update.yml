      I just packed up the new version of
      [Screensavr](http://telemachus.local/simonheys/website/2007/01/21/screensavr-alpha/)
      which I hacked together yesterday. Now automatically fills the screen,
      does different image proportions and can also read Groups. Next stage is
      to get it to honour all image proportions and handle different sized
      images. Then it shall be complete.
