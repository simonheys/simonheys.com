      So I have reach a dead-end in Flash. I now have a Screensavr that works
      perfectly, honouring all image proportions. Looks great, but runs slowly
      in Flash as it can’t handle so many individual images as the bitmap
      processing isn’t sophisticated enough; had to make it so that each row is
      a series of MovieClips rather than one BitmapData object. Setting
      cacheAsBitmap was causing too much flickering; turning it off makes it run
      too slow.


      Unless there’s a major brainwave, a Cocoa rewrite is on the cards. This
      could take some time…
