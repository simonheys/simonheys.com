  New version, Mac native code this time. Thanks to Andy and Jay for
  suggestions: now you can choose your own colours and font. Not that there was
  anything wrong with my choices. Planning to add finer typographic control in
  future, but for now… enjoy playing with the leading. Visit Word Clock’s

      New version, Mac native code this time. Thanks to
      [Andy](http://www.multiadaptor.com/) and [Jay](http://www.jayglow.com/)
      for suggestions: now you can choose your own colours and font. Not that
      there was anything wrong with my choices. Planning to add finer
      typographic control in future, but for now… enjoy playing with the
      leading.
